@title[#:tag "Extort"]{Extort: when errors exist}

Up until now we have worked to maintain a single type of values:
integers.  This led to some awkwardness in the design of conditionals.
Let us lift this restriction by considering a multiplicity of types.
To start, we will consider two: integers and booleans.

We'll call it @bold{Extort}.

Nothing changes in the syntax of Extort from Dupe, although we will
need to talk about two kinds of @emph{results} from evaluating
programs: values and errors.  We will say that evaluation produces an
@bold{answer}, which is either a value or error:

@centered{@render-language[E]}

@section{Meaning of Extort programs}

The meaning of Extort programs...

@itemlist[

@item{...}

]

Let's consider some examples:

@itemlist[

@item{...}

]

Languages adopt several approaches to type mismatches:

@itemlist[

@item{Prohibit such programs statically with a type system (e.g. OCaml, Java)}
@item{Coerce values to different types (e.g. JavaScript)}
@item{Signal a run-time error (e.g. Racket)}
@item{Leave the behavior unspecified (e.g. Scheme, C)}

]

We've previously seen the last approach.  Now let's do what Racket
does and signal an error.


The semantics...

@(define ((rewrite s) lws)
   (define lhs (list-ref lws 2))
   (define rhs (list-ref lws 3))
   (list "" lhs (string-append " " (symbol->string s) " ") rhs ""))

@(require (only-in racket add-between))
@(define-syntax-rule (show-judgment name i j)
   (with-unquote-rewriter
      (lambda (lw)
        (build-lw (lw-e lw) (lw-line lw) (lw-line-span lw) (lw-column lw) (lw-column-span lw)))
      (with-compound-rewriters (['+ (rewrite '+)]
                                ['- (rewrite '‚Äì)]
                                ['= (rewrite '=)]
				['!= (rewrite '‚â†)])
        (apply centered
	   (add-between 
             (build-list (- j i)
	                 (Œª (n) (begin (judgment-form-cases (list (+ n i)))
	                               (render-judgment-form name))))
             (hspace 4))))))

@(show-judgment ùë¨ 0 3)
@(show-judgment ùë¨ 3 7)



Now what does the semantics say about @racket['(add1 #f)]?  What about
@racket['(if 7 #t -2)]?


The interpreter ...

@codeblock-include["extort/interp.rkt"]

We can confirm the interpreter computes the right result for the
examples given earlier:

@ex[
'...
]

Correctness...

@section{An Example of Extort compilation}

Suppose we want to compile ...

What needs to happen? ...

@;codeblock-include["extort/asm/ast.rkt"]

We omit the printer code, which is mundane.  See
@link["extort/asm/printer.rkt"]{@tt{asm/printer.rkt}} for details.

Compiler...

@;codeblock-include["extort/compile.rkt"]

@;{
@ex[
(asm-interp (compile #t))
(asm-interp (compile #f))
(asm-interp (compile '(zero? 0)))
(asm-interp (compile '(zero? -7)))
(asm-interp (compile '(if #t 1 2)))
(asm-interp (compile '(if #f 1 2)))
(asm-interp (compile '(if (zero? 0) (if (zero? 0) 8 9) 2)))
(asm-interp (compile '(if (zero? (if (zero? 2) 1 0)) 4 5)))
]
}
