DVH rewrite Fall 2020

Goals:

- Make self-hosting by end <-- This likely won't happen this semester
- Eliminate quasiqote, unquote usage.
- Eliminate s-expr-based data types.
- Eliminate lexing and parsing; use read from start.
- Add I/O, read-byte, write-byte.  Build from there.
- Add symbols w/ symbol table.
- Add GC.
- Add Bignums. <-- Likely won't happen
- Rewrite assignments. <-- Leaving up to LL and JC
- More static checking & better error messages for a86 before generating nasm.
  Should be impossible to generate code that nasm rejects.

Possible assignment ideas:

- After Extort: catch and signal errors on integer over/under-flow
- Implement an interpreter for a86 (the mini-x86 language)
- Implement read-char, peek-char in terms of read-byte, peek-byte
- Implement read in terms of read-char, peek-char
- Implement prefab structures
- Implement bignum arithmetic library
